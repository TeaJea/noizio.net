# noizio.net

The simple application that lives in your tray and allows to set a custom background noise. Imagine yourself sitting in a quiet Paris cafe, on the sea shore or near the campfire in the forest at night. All you need to relax or boost your productivity.

It is greatly inspired by Noizio (http://noiz.io) application for Mac.
